# senegal_crop_model

## Summary
This project implements AquacropOS-Py to trun simulations of millet or sorghum.<br>
The  model controller is aquacrop_senegal_impl.py.<br>
It makes use of crop_config.py and soil_config.py to build soil and crop inputs.<br>
Information on the software can be found here:<br>
Helpful notebooks here:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/thomasdkelly/aquacrop/ <br>
Aquacrop python documentation here as well: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377421002419


## Custom python files
***aquacrop_senegal_impl.py***: This controls the simulation, looping over the major variable that can be set for our exercise.<br>
***crop_config.py***: Basically just a big lookup table for the crop and its properties. We have 2 crops, 1 sorghum and 1 millet configured from the literature.<br>
***soil_config.py***: Build soils, particularly the individual, custom layers of the soil profile, from the SoilGrids based datafile into an Aquacrop soil format.



## Datafiles Input
### Weather
***ZoneName_Nasa_chirpsAQ_OUT.TXT*** : These files were output from the aquacrop desktop software.
### Soil
***AEZ_samples_with_soil2.txt*** : this file was generated by Tara Ippolito from SoilGrids V2 data for each agroecozone in Senegal.
